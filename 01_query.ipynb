    "5. You can add new cells, but again, you have to be careful about the order you run them in.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Read the metadata and the documentation to make sure you understand the tables, their columns, and what they mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Develop queries incrementally: start with something simple, test it, and add a little bit at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use ADQL features like `TOP` and `COUNT` to test before you run a query that might return a lot of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you know your query will return fewer than 2000 rows, you can run it synchronously, which might complete faster.  If it might return more than 2000 rows, you should run it asynchronously.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ADQL and SQL are not case-sensitive, so you don't have to capitalize the keywords, but you should.\n",
