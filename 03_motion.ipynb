    "* We identified a region of proper motion that contains stars likely to be in GD-1.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We used a Boolean `Series` as a mask to select stars whose proper motion is in that region.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have used data from a relatively small region of the sky.  In the next lesson, we'll write a query that selects stars based on proper motion, which will allow us to explore a larger region."

    "\n",
    "* When you make a scatter plot, adjust the size of the markers and their transparency so the figure is not overplotted; otherwise it can misrepresent the data badly.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For simple scatter plots in Matplotlib, `plot` is faster than `scatter`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* An Astropy `Table` and a Pandas `DataFrame` are similar in many ways and they provide many of the same functions.  They have pros and cons, but for many projects, either one would be a reasonable choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "* To store data from a Pandas `DataFrame`, a good option is an HDF file, which can contain multiple Datasets."
